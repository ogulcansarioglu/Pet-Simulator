# Petty
Petty is a pet simulator aimed to help people who want to adopt a pet for the first time. It simulated the needs of the pets realistically as it can be so the user can decide after a month of usage if they can do it or not. This prevents owners from giving up their pets after they realized it's not for them. It is an open-source project, trying to help both animals and people who want to adopt them.
